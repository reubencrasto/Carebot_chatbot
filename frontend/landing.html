				<p class="text-center">
					A large number of students face some sort of mental health illness such as depression, anxiety, stress, etc. Due to the lack of willingness, trust, or financial ability many students do not visit a  college counselor or seek professional help. The proposed system aims to ease this problem by providing a chatbot to students that would provide the required support similar to a counselor or therapist. Recent use of technology in aiding Mental Health recovery has proven to be highly effective in terms of machine learning. The method involves surveys, questionnaires, data analysis, and natural language processing. The aim is to build an online platform through which the tool will function. Leveraging the use of standard medically issued mental health questionnaires with a responsive module as a cohesive unit will provide insights on how a user interacts with different testing methods and whether they have had a positive experience.
